## Introduction to the CLRS Benchmark Paper and Background Context

### What is the CLRS Benchmark?

 The CLRS Benchmark is an attempt at measuring the progress made towards teaching neural networks how to perform algorithmic reasoning tasks, such as sorting arrays or finding the shortest path between two nodes on a graph.
 
 The paper that introduces this benchmark was presented at the International Conference of Machine Learning (ICML) in 2022.  The main contributor is Petar Velickovic, a researcher at Deepmind.  You can find out more about Petar [here](https://petar-v.com/)
 
 The CLRS Benchmark takes its name from the authors of the seminal Introduction to Algorithms textbook by Cormen, Leiserston, Rivest, and Stein.  This textbook is ubiquitous among graduate level computer science programs.
